This directory contains a database for a fake web site.
Standard web page for the persons listed in db.lua are created
automatically from template.html with staff.lua.
(See http://www.cos.ufrj.br for a real web site created in this way.)

To run, type lua db.lua.

This example is meant to show the power of gsub and Lua declarative constructs,
which have been combined here into a "mail-merge" application.
