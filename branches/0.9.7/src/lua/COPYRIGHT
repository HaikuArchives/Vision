Lua Copyright Notice
--------------------

Lua is free and non-proprietary.
It can be used for both academic and commercial purposes at absolutely no cost.
There are no royalties or GNU-like "copyleft" restrictions.
Lua (probably) qualifies as Open Source software.
Nevertheless, Lua is not in the public domain and TeCGraf keeps its copyright. 

If you use Lua, please give us credit (a nice way to do this is to include a
Lua logo in a web page for your product), but we would appreciate *not*
receiving lengthy legal documents to sign.

The legal details are below.
