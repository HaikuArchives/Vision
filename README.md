# Vision
A native BeOS IRC client that is feature filled, fast, lightweight, and stable.

Vision is an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) client, originally for
BeOS, now for Haiku. The goal of this project is to provide the BeOS/Haiku
community with an elegant, fast, and--most importantly--stable client to
communicate with other users and make new friends around the world.
