[0.1.0324]
 2001-03-24
   * Add support for numeric 439 (target change too fast)
   * Add support for /dccallow (bahamut)
   * Resolve conflict between /dccallow and /whois on bahamut and ultimate, both
     use the same numeric for one of the replies.
   * Add support for various bahamut whois numerics (308, 309, 310)
   * Do some reshuffling with locks in ServerAgent and Establish()
   * Fix a bug in MessageAgent where doing /me would change the WindowListItem's
     name to yours
   * Implemented /map support on various ircds (005, 006, 007, 115, 117)
   * Shift+Enter won't select all text anymore in the Input control, it will
     be treated as a normal Enter keypress.

[0.1.0322]
 2001-03-23
   * Fix "function race" issues with the random thread names used by Establish()
   * Fix Home+End to work in the Input control, use Alt+ for the IRCView
   * Completed implemention of WindowList::SetName(). MessageAgents now update
     their WindowList entry on new incommgin messages (case adjustment for example)
     and nick change. Channel name's to follow.
 2001-03-22
   * Added support for !channels to /j|/join (the ID is still shown everywhere
     though--todo for later) 
   * Fixed a shadowing BMessage I overlooked when I added /msg (it was actually
     declaring x but using msg y (declared somewhere else!) oops!
   * Add support for numeric 437 -- nick/channel unavailable. Vision can
     now catch it on connect as well and try an alternate nickname (ala nick
     in use)
   * PageUp/PageDn/Home/End work without Alt now
   * Fix a bug with WindowList::AddAgent where an item loses selection
     if the new agent isn't immedietly activated
   * Add keyboard nav shortcuts
   * MessageAgent does what it needs to with M_NICK_CHANGE msgs now
   * Forgot to update Makefile :)
   * /msg now works decently
   * MessageAgent responds to M_CLIENT_QUIT now
   * Tweak some spacing/margin issues with the IRCView and Input controls
     on the ClientWindow
   * MessageAgent is working for the most part, still needs some more
     tweaks and clean up
   * Added some more random Establish() thread names
