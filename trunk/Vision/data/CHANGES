[0.2.0421]
 2001-04-21
   * Logging support
     - /setbool log_enabled true and restart any agents you want logging
     - For dated log filenames ("#beos_20010421.log") use
       /setbool log_filetimestamp true and restart any agents you want.
   * Pressing single byte keys (like Backspace or arrows) while the IRCView
     has focus doesnt put a garbage chracter in the input control.
   * The spam/single line dialog when pasting multiple lines is now
     non-blocking
   * Shift+Up/Down-Arrow will jump to to the prev/next agent with nick activity
     (red entry). If one isn't found it will jump to the prev/next agent with
     normal activity (green). If one isn't found it will jump to the adjacent
     agent.

[0.2.0420]
 2001-04-20
   * Fixed a crasher when pasting multiple lines and parting a channel
   * Added a u2-kludge fix regarding chankeys, which the u2 ircd may ommit
     from the chanmode request reply.

[0.2.0419]
 2001-04-19
   * Auto reconnect is working
   * Lag meter is working
   * Removed a debuging line from the ERR_UNKNOWNCOMMAND numeric

[0.2.0418]
 2001-04-18
   * Establish() always thought your IP was private, no matter what it actually
     was.
   * Fixed a big (non crashing) bug in IRCView. Elements weren't getting
     deleted properly from the scrollback buffer. This broke URLs if you were
     in a channel for a very long time.


[0.2.0417]
 2001-04-17
   * Code audit time!
     - Removed the last of those nasty tab characters from the code.
     - Changed the scopes in all switch()'s to result in better memory
       management and smaller binary size.
     - Changed some BString <<'s to BString += that I missed in the last audit
       (+= is faster)
     - Cut down on duplicate code in some switch cases.
   * /dns <nick> will work in MessageAgents now
   * Added Local IP lookup, along with a check to see if it's a private IP.
   * We qualify for version 0.2 now.

[0.1.0414]
 2001-04-14
   * Fix regression from yesterday's myNick fix; all nick changes were showing in
     all MessageAgents for that server
   * Added visual keyboard shortcut identifiers to VTextControl for Copy/Cut/etc
   * Tweaked the width of ChannelAgent's IRCView. It was off by 1px.

[0.1.0412]
 2001-04-12
   * *Vision* compiles under Takashi's gcc 2.95.3 release now. Lua does not.
   * Fix myNick changes so they update the MessageAgent's StatusView immedietly
   * Slightly darker action color, you won't notice it really... but it looks
     less like shit on a low-bpp display

[0.1.0411]
 2001-04-11
   * Update the StatusView's nickname on connect, so it uses the new nick if
     its changed (e.g.: your alt. nick)
   * Modified the default /uptime|ctcp uptime reply text
   * Change the default (temp) server back to irc.elric.net
   * Remove some redundant drawing stuff from WinList... a *lot* less flickering
     now.
   * Remove some redundant drawing stuff from StatusView. Ditto on the flickering.

[0.1.0409]
 2001-04-10
   * Fix an issue where joining multiple channels quickly would cause NickList sorting
     issues (/join #chan1,#chan2 for example). This fixes a couple other theoretical
     cases, too.
   * Change the default action color to purple. Who picked red variations for just
     about every event anyway!? This makes it easier to see actions among quits
 2001-04-09
   * Shift+Enter won't select the input controls text anymore, it will function
     like a normal Enter keypress.
   * Typing a line more than 440 characters will result it in it being split
     into a second line. This is to prevent the server from truncating it for
     you and resulting in lost text. (ChannelAgent only)
   * Started Gnome implementation
   * Changed <nick> coloration
   * Lots of code changes

[0.1.0402]
 2001-04-02
   * Made right click context menus more dynamic, and are generated by the
     ClientAgent itself depending on what derived it (ChannelAgent, MessageAgent,
     etc.)
   * Added MessageAgent-specific options to MessageAgent's context menu
   * The WindowList now uses the new dynamic context menus
   * Removed nickname color changing from M_CHANNEL_MSG, this will be moved to
     IRCView soon. This fixes the nickname-in-url issue, as well as the totally
     sucky implementation of otherNick (would color seemingly random nicknames)
   * Added Ctrl+up/down to ClientAgent for scrolling "line-by-line"
   * Added Ctrl+pageup/pagedown to ClientAgent in addition to pageup/pagedown for
     consistancy
   * Moved alt+home/end to Ctrl+home/end

[0.1.0330]
 2001-03-30
   * Add !channel support to /m
   * Add an invalid parameters output to various commands (instead of just doing
     nothing)
   * /google and /webster|/dictionary will load the home pages if you don't enter
     a query string
   * Change SetupWindow's default to irc.exodusirc.net instead of irc.elric.net
   * ChannelAgent, ClientAgent code cleanup, squeezed some performance out of
     various functions
   * cleaned up the code for /visit
   * /google loads up Google.com with the search string
   * /webster|/dictionary load up Dictionary.com with the search string
   * Changed to Dictionary.com instead of Webster 1913

[0.1.0329]
 2001-03-29
   * Aliased /rrun to /pexec
   * New IRCView scrolling logic! Yay!
     - Increased scrollback buffer to 192,000 bytes.
     - IRCView won't try to bring you back down to the bottom if you are
       scrolled up.
     - If your scrolled up, IRCView won't clip unless you reach a higher
       threshold (500,000 bytes), so text wont jump around while your trying
       to read. This is so if you scroll up for some reason and leave your
       keyboard, the scrollback buffer wont fill up forever.
   * Tab complete now works on your own nick as well in MessageAgents
   * /exit .... exits.
   * M_OPEN_MSGAGENT will activate the query window if it already exists
   * /query will now send any text after the nick to the new query window (or the
     query window already open, if that's the case)
   * Reverse the default behavior of /msg, doesn't create a new /msg window on
     /msg
   * Make WindowListItem->SetName and SetStatus only Invalidate themselves and
     not the whole view.
   * Squeeze a half a microsecond of performance out of /setbool by changing
     an if to an else if.

[0.1.0328]
 2001-03-28
   * Add a Window Lock() to WindowListItem->SetName and SetStatus to try and
     prevent a crasher.
   * Rename Server Agent -> Server Window in the Window menu
   * Another attempt at resolving some crashes from canceled connections
   * Fixed a strange case where the someone-said-your-nick bit would get reset
     back to there-is-new-text bit for WindowListItems.

[0.1.0327]
 2001-03-27
   * Move TestScript's to a -T status option (fixes crash on startup when being
     launched via app-sig)
   * Fix some ServerAgent/Establish crashes from failed/canceled connections

[0.1.0326]

     isn't made active immediately

   * StatusView's are updated with the proper servername
   * Now intelligently selects the previously active agent when closing the

   * Make VisionVersion BString static
   * Move M_MOVE_UP/M_MOVE_DOWN uint declarations to ClientWindow where they
     should be instead of ClientAgent
   * Bring back Alt+P to close the active window
   * Move Alt+Up/Down shortcuts back to the Window menu
   * Double clicking on a NickListItem opens a query window
   * /q|/query works now

   * Add support for numeric 439 (target change too fast)

     name to yours
   * Implemented /map support on various ircds (005, 006, 007, 115, 117)
   * Shift+Enter won't select all text anymore in the Input control, it will

 2001-03-23
   * Fix "function race" issues with the random thread names used by Establish()
   * Fix Home+End to work in the Input control, use Alt+ for the IRCView
   * Completed implemention of WindowList::SetName(). MessageAgents now update
     their WindowList entry on new incommgin messages (case adjustment for example)
     and nick change. Channel name's to follow.
 2001-03-22
   * Added support for !channels to /j|/join (the ID is still shown everywhere
     though--todo for later) 
   * Fixed a shadowing BMessage I overlooked when I added /msg (it was actually
     declaring x but using msg y (declared somewhere else!) oops!
