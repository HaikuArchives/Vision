This is Lua 4.0.
See HISTORY for a summary of changes since the last version.

* What is Lua?
  ------------
  Lua is a powerful, light-weight programming language designed for extending
  applications. Lua is also frequently used as a general-purpose, stand-alone
  language.

  Lua combines simple procedural syntax (similar to Pascal) with powerful
  data description constructs based on associative arrays and extensible
  semantics. Lua is dynamically typed, interpreted from bytecodes, and has
  automatic memory management, making it ideal for configuration, scripting,
  and rapid prototyping.

  Lua is a language engine that you can embed into your application.
  This means that, besides syntax and semantics, Lua has an API that
  allows the application to exchange data with Lua programs and also to
  extend Lua with C functions. In this sense, Lua can be regarded as a
  language framework for building domain-specific languages.

  Lua is implemented as a small library of C functions, written in ANSI C,
  and compiles unmodified in all known platforms. The implementation goals
  are simplicity, efficiency, portability, and low embedding cost.
  The result is a fast language engine with small footprint, making it
  ideal in embedded systems too.

  Lua was awarded the first prize (technological category) in the
  Second Compaq Award for Research and Development in Computer Science in 1997.
  This award was a joint venture of Compaq Computer in Brazil, the Brazilian
  Ministry of Science and Technology, and the Brazilian Academy of Sciences.

  Lua has been used in many different projects around the world.
