This is the standard Lua library.
It is implemented entirely on top of the official Lua API as declared in lua.h,
using lauxlib.c, which contains several useful functions for writing libraries. 
We encourage developers to use lauxlib.c in their own libraries.
The code of the standard library can be read as an example of how to export
C functions to Lua.
